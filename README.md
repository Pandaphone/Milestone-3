# Milestone-3

Persona is my submission for my Final Project. This application is intended to be a place to list all the online identities one's created and easily keep track of them.

Have a persona with your real name but also one with a made-up psuedonym? Have trouble keeping up with all the spur-of-the-moment usernames you generated because the ones you wanted were taken? This is your solution!
